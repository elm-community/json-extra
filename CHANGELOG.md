### 4.3.0

**Additions:**
- `fromMaybe`: Like `fromResult` but for `Maybe a`

### 4.2.0

**Additions:**
- `optionalNullableField`: Putting `optionalField` and `nullable` together

### 4.1.0

**Additions:**
- `url`: Decode JSON strings to `elm/url#Url`s

### 4.0.0

**Removals:**
- `dict`: `elm/json` already comes with a `dict` encoder

**Additions:**
- `datetime`: Re-introduce decoding a date+time, to `Posix`

**Changes:**
- doc tests are re-enabled
- docs are fixed

### 3.0.0

**Removals**
- `date`: Initial 0.19 compatibility means (temporarily) removing the `date** decoder

**Other stuff:**
- Elm 0.19 support!
- doc tests are disabled for now

### 2.6.0

**Additions:**
- `keys` allows extracting _only_ the keys from a JSON object

### 2.5.0

**Additions:**
- `dict` helps encoding `Dict`

### 2.4.0

**Additions:**
- `collection` helps with decoding array-like JavaScript structures such as `HTMLCollection`
- `combine` helps combining a `List` of decoders into a single `Decoder` for a `List` of such things

### 2.3.0

**Additions:**
- `indexedList` to get access to the current js array index while decoding

**Other Stuff:**
- `elm-doc-test` is now `elm-verify-examples`!

### 2.2.0

**Additions:**
- `parseInt` and `parseFloat` for weird api's that return numbers as strings
- `doubleEncoded` for a more generic _json as a string in json_ issues

**Fixes:**
- `optionalField` decodes the field, rather than the surrounding object now.

**Other Stuff:**
- Code Style conforms to elm-format@exp
- Doc tests!
- Travis integration

### 2.1.0

**Additions:**
- `optionalField : String -> Json.Decode.Decoder a -> Json.Decode.Decoder (Maybe.Maybe a)` - Decode an optional field, succeeding with `Nothing` if it is missing, but still giving an error if it is malformed.

### 2.0.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Upgrade for Elm 0.18
- Removed `maybeNull` in favor of `Json.Decode.nullable`
- Removed `lazy` in favor of `Json.Decode.lazy`
- Renamed `apply` to `andMap` and reversed arguments to `Decoder a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b` to make it work nicely with `(|>)`

**Additions:**
- `fromResult : Result String a -> Decoder a` - convert a `Result` to a `Decoder`, helpful in `andThen` callbacks following the removal of `Json.Decode.customDecoder`
- `Json.Encode.Extra.maybe : (a -> Value) -> Maybe a -> Value` - encode a `Maybe a` given an encoder for `a`. Thanks to @hendore for this addition.

**Other Stuff:**
- Code style conforms to elm-format

#### 1.1.0

**Additions:**
- `Json.Decode.Extra.sequence` - lets you generate a list of `Decoder a` and attempt to apply them to a JSON list. _Authored by @cobalamin_


#### 1.0.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Upgrade for Elm 0.17
